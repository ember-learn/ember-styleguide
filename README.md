# ember-styleguide [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-learn/ember-styleguide.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-learn/ember-styleguide) [![Latest NPM release](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ember-styleguide.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-styleguide.svg)

This addon is intended to provide basic components for easier style coordination among the Ember family of websites, although the original intent is to support the emberjs.com website. We are committed to the goal of meeting WCAG 2.0 AA conformance standards.

## WIP Notes

* Each component must have the component name attached to the component as a CSS class.
* It may feel as though there is duplicated code throughout these components; during the WIP process, we are favoring duplication over abstraction. 
* Font icons through ember-font-awesome
* The `es-pagewrapper` component has a property to indicate if there will be a sidebar or not. There might be a better way to do this.
* In this addon, the `section` element is used as a container and is intended to span the full width of the viewport.
