# Typography

I suppose this is for the text-preset stuff? 

## Sizes

Use `.xsmall` for small headings or notice paragraphs.
<div class="xsmall mb-large">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>

Use `.small` for body text, navigation items or links. This is also the default paragraph size.
<div class="small mb-large">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>

Use `.medium` for section headings. This is also the default size for the `h3` element.
<div class="medium mb-large">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>

Use `.large` for content page headings. This is also the default size for the `h2` element.
<div class="large mb-large">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>

Use `.xlarge` for landing page headlines. This is also the default size for the `h1` element.
<div class="xlarge mb-large">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>

## Weights

Use `.light`
<div class="medium light mb-large">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
Use `.regular`
<div class="medium regular mb-large">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
