# Introduction

```sh
ember install ember-styleguide
```

## Understanding ember-styleguide

As we were working on the Ember.js website, we found ourselves wanting a more scalable approach to all of the Ember family of websites.

Currently, these websites are considered "core" websites and are maintained by contributors:

- emberjs.com
- cli.emberjs.com
- guides.emberjs.com
- deprecations.emberjs.com
- help-wanted.emberjs.com
- api.emberjs.com

There are also other websites that are still maintained by contributors but would need an upgrade to be able to avail of ember-styleguide

- ember-fastboot.com
- ember-engines.com

Ember components are ideal for this, because all of these websites need similar types of components. By standardizing our component approach, we could more easily contribute to any of the websites in the Ember ecosystem.

## Goals

This project is currently in active development status.

We intend to provide an easy way to create a fully accessible Ember site from the components offered in this addon.

## Contributing to the project

As with any Ember project, contributions are welcome! Visit [https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide) to file an issue or even better, submit a PR!

If you have questions about the design/architecture, please contact [Melanie Sumner](mailto:melaniersumner@gmail.com) directly.
